Exercises from the SOLID Book.

### Chapter 1

Just some introductory Typescript. I added ESLint and Prettier configs from [this](https://www.robertcooper.me/using-eslint-and-prettier-in-a-typescript-project) article (without the React specific stuff).

An introduction to many Typescript features. Many are common to OO languages. Some interesting callouts..

- Interoperability between classes, interfaces, custom type
- Interfaces can extend other interfaces
- Union types
- Inline types look a little like Elixir's pattern matching capabilities, but you cannot create multiple inline type definitions for a method with the same name.
- typeof (as in normal js) + instanceof + 'in' keyword for type guards
